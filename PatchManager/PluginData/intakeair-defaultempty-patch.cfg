// for some reason, the recourse 'IntakeAir' has a weight? but its air??? so whenever you place an intake, part of the wet mass of your plane is just air
// and unless you have a mod like FillItUp, there's no way to 'drain' the intake air out of your plane
// this patch sets the default amount of air in your intakes to 0 so your wet/dry mass calculations don't get thrown off
// once you launch the plane, the air should automatically be replenished so jet engines will still work exactly the same
