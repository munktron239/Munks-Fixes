// changes some stats of the worst probecore in the game to be a bit more like KSP2, where it was slightly less useless.

// the description of the stayputnik claims that it can run for 10 minutes, but it dies after 6 minutes in-game.
// This bothered me, so I wrote this patch to slightly lower its consumption of EC so that it used 1 EC/min.
// This way it dies after its internal battery (10 ec) runs out after 10 mins, just like the description claims.

// now the stayputnik needs 60% less EC/min, lowered from 0.02777778.
// No one really uses the stayputnik anyway, so I don't think this patch will change the game balance all that much.

// for some reason they lowered the ec consumption of the stayputnik in KSP2... but only down to 1.5 per minute, which is still way too high for an extremely basic probecore
