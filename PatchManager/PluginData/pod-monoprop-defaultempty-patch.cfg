// sets the internal monopropellant tanks of the command pods in-game to 0, so you don't have to manually remember to do it every time.
// 99% of the time, you don't even need the monoprop anyway, and if you do need it, you usually have a bigger tank somewhere else.

// This patch doesn't remove the monoprop from pods that have built-in thrusters (I.E, the Mk1-3 pod, M.E.M., most of the NF spacecraft pods, etc.)
