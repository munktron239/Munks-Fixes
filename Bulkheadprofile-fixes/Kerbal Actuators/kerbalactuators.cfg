// tweak bulkheadprofiles of kerbalactuators parts to better fit their size
// (totally didnt steal this code from sheepdog. just dont tell them ok)
@PART[wbiSampleCrane]:NEEDS[KerbalActuators]	{	%bulkheadProfiles = size00, srf		}	// slightly smaller than size0
@PART[wbiSampleArm]:NEEDS[KerbalActuators]	{	%bulkheadProfiles = size0, srf		}	// has a size0 docking port so its made size0
