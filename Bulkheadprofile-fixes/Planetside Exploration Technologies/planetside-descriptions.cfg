// unfortunately Benjee10 did not include a localization file in his mod... with a bunch of parts... and dozens of descriptions...
// so this patch fixes a bunch of descriptions. Normally, I wouldn't include this as I keep all localization changes to myself, but for this mod, I figured I'd add it
// (this definitely wasn't a way for me to check which parts I had changed manually, nosiree)
