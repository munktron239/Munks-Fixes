//technically should be size 2, but I instead measured the diameter of the antenna itself (so it won't mess up the order of the stock relay antennas)
@PART[ju1MDA]:NEEDS[JX2Antenna]		{	@bulkheadProfiles = size4	}
@PART[jw1MDA]:NEEDS[JX2Antenna]		{	@bulkheadProfiles = size1	} // remove surface attachment because it can't surface attach?
@PART[jx2LDA]:NEEDS[JX2Antenna]		{	@bulkheadProfiles = size8	} // same reasoning as above, radius is bigger than this, but 10m is the "biggest" for most mods
