// technically should be size 2, but I instead measured the diameter of the antenna itself (so it won't mess up the order of the stock relay antennas)
@PART[ju1MDA]:NEEDS[JX2Antenna]	{	@bulkheadProfiles = size4	}
@PART[jw1MDA]:NEEDS[JX2Antenna]	{	@bulkheadProfiles = size1	}	// remove surface attachment because it can't surface attach?
@PART[jx2LDA]:NEEDS[JX2Antenna]	{	@bulkheadProfiles = size8	}	// same reasoning as above (radius is bigger than this, but 10m is the "biggest" for most mods)
