// in KSP2, all command pods could transmit data, which made their internal antennae a but more useful.
// i really liked this feature, and wanted to find a way to add it to KSP1 while also being balanced.
// as a compromise, all stock pods and probes can now transmit data (like crew reports), but not very efficiently.
// the bandwidth is 60% that of the most basic antenna at 2.0 mits/second compared to the communotron 16's 3.33 mits/second
// it also uses 33% more power as well, requiring 8 ec per mit vs the C16's 6 ec/mit
// so overall, you would be better off using a dedicated antenna part, but if you don't have one, you can still transmit.
// in my testing it takes just under 50 EC to transmit a crew report, which is about the capacity of the early pods.
// so the tradeoff is that you can transmit one (1) science report... but now you have no battery for reaction wheels, etc

// lots of parts in the game have ModuleDataTransmitter, and they are either: A. a command part which needs this (pods, probes, etc) or B. an antenna, direct or relay
// However, 2 parts in the game have ModuleDataTransmitter but are not an antenna part or a command part, which makes the module quite useless
// the only situation where you would need a part that has a data transmitter, but DON'T have a command part with one would be like if...
// ...if you used the external command chair (the only command part without a data transmitter) and the Mk1 Crew Cabin as some kind of 'rover'... but that's quite silly
// This patch makes these 2 parts (the 2.5m service module and Mk1 crew cabin) a bit more useful by allowing them to transmit science
// don't know why Squad didn't do this in the first place...
