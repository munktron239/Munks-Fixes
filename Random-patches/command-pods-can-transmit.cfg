// in KSP2, all command pods could transmit data, which made their internal antennae a but more useful.
// i really liked this feature, and wanted to find a way to add it to KSP1 while also being balanced.
// as a compromise, all stock pods and probes can now transmit data (like crew reports), but not very efficiently.
// the bandwidth is 60% that of the most basic antenna at 2.0 mits/second compared to the communotron 16's 3.33 mits/second
// it also uses 33% more power as well, requiring 8 ec per mit vs the C16's 6 ec/mit
// so overall, you would be better off using a dedicated antenna part, but if you don't have one, you can still transmit.
// in my testing it takes just under 50 EC to transmit a crew report, which is about the capacity of the early pods.
// so the tradeoff is that you can transmit one (1) science report... but now you have no battery for reaction wheels, etc
