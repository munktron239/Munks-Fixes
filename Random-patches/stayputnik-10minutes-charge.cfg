// the description of the stayputnik claims that it can run for 10 minutes, but it dies after 6 minutes in game
// this bother me, so i wrote this patch to slightly lower it's consumption of EC so that it used 1 ec/min
// this way it dies after its internal battery (10 ec) runs out after 10 mins, just like the description claims

// now the stayputnik needs 60% less EC/min, lowered from 0.02777778
// no one really uses the stayputnik anyways so i don't think this patch will change the game balance all that much
