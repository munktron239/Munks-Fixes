// This patch re-adds some of the 'removed' parts from Nerteas mods.
// No politics here, nosiree. Just some good ol' KSP parts. Any relation to existing real-life spacecraft is purely coincidental.

	@category = Pods
	@TechHidden = False
	@description = A 2 Kerbal capsule with a clever design that has the ability to support use of Chickadee engines - for abort procedures and propulsive landings.

{
	@category = Pods
	@TechHidden = False
	@description = The ultimate orbital drop-pod - capable of bringing 3 Kerbals to a soft landing on any planet with its included Chickadee engines! Chickadee engines not included. RCS is, however.

{
	@category = Engine
	@TechHidden = False
	@description = A dual-purpose monopropellant engine intended as a landing and abort system for the Nereid and Tethys. You can use them elsewhere, and you'll get great thrust and gimbal, but I hope you're not expecting efficiency.

{
	@category = Propulsion
	@TechHidden = False
	@description = A miracle of an engine designed for clustering and heavy re-use, perfect for your more demanding high-tech lifters.

{
	@category = Propulsion
	@TechHidden = False
	@description = Even in space, you can't escape the Deinoychus. Post-Kerbin brings you the Eagle, a vacuum-optimized version that can break the sky on a budget. Methalox...uh...finds a way.

{
	@category = Propulsion
	@TechHidden = False
	@description = A surprisingly simple and cheap booster engine, enough so to be assembled by child Kerbals, a market in which this engine has seen great success. Moving parts - not for Kerbal children.

	@description = The Otter, but in SPAAAAAACEEE (vacuum optimized)!! Warranty void if ignited below 1 kPa.
