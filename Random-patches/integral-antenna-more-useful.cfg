// lots of parts in the game have ModuleDataTransmitter, and they are either: A. a command part which needs this (pods, probes, etc) or B. an antenna, direct or relay
// However, 2 parts in the game have ModuleDataTransmitter but are not an antenna part or a command part, which makes the module quite useless
// the only situation where you would need a part that has a data transmitter, but DON'T have a command part with one would be like if...
// ...if you used the external command chair (the only command part without a data transmitter) and the Mk1 Crew Cabin as some kind of 'rover'... but that's quite silly
// This patch makes these 2 parts (the 2.5m service module and Mk1 crew cabin) a bit more useful by allowing them to transmit science
// don't know why Squad didn't do this in the first place...

// thanks to user @SkyFall2489 on the forums for helping me fix this
