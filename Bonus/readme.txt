The Bonus™ Folder! A place where I put things I've coded that don't really fit in anywhere, even with RandomPatches!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are a bunch of MapDecals for the bases in the Original KerbinSide mod, as well as some other niche KK launch sites
If you have these mods installed, this will remove the trees added by mods like Parallax
You might need KerbalKonstructs for these patches to work, though...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is also a set of slightly modified versions of the bonus patches from ReStock Plus. Useful if you want to take advantage of the
Functionality of restock plus, while still only using stock parts.
They only kick in if you DON'T have restock plus installed, so don't worry about compatibility.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lastly, there are a couple of waterfall configs I wrote for some engines. They look decent-ish, and can be toggled with B9PartSwitch

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I might add more things in the future to this folder. Check my profile on Fang Fridays for news - I'll try and keep y'all posted!
