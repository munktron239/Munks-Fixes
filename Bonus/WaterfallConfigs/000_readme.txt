Bonus folder: Waterfall configs!

Most of these patches add plume switching to several engines, mostly kerolox/hypergolic ones.
they won't affect the current plumes of engines, and instead adds a B9 switcher to select which plume you want

all of the patches have been tested with stock/restock so don't worry about compatibility.
also: there are some new plumes too - the Restock Reliant engine gets a exhaust dump plume and the Snazzy 1.875m tank gets new SRB plumes (Avalanche mod required)

---known issues---

the console logs says that there are a ton of warnings and errors when selecting the plumes I've added... and i don't know enough about Waterfall on how to fix them...
If you have any idea on how to fix the plumes feel free to message me on the KSP forums at @munktron239
