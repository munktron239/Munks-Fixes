RandomPatches 2: the Sequel! (TM)

These are a bunch of new patches I've all written recently. 

Patches with 'better' or 'fix' improve things in the game
Patches with 'new' add new stuff
Patches with 'MH' affect parts from MakingHistory
Patches with 'ksp2' add in things from KSP2
Patches with 'random' change miscellaneous things

Some patches are pretty game-changing, so they are left as .txt files. You can rename them to .cfg to get them to activate
