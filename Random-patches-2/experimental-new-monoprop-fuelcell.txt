// give command pods that have internal monopropellant tanks a small, monopropellant-powered fuel cell

// only gives it to pods that DON'T have integrated RCS thrusters (as the monopropellant tanks would be for those instead, both would require too much plumbing)
// reasoning: in real life, many spacecraft were powered by fuel cells. and since (most) command pods in KSP have monopropellant tanks...
// ... it only makes sense that the pods come pre-installed with a way to use it!

// stats: only 50% of the power generated, uses 1 unit of monoprop/min (~2.8 times more then the Restock+ Monoprop fuel cell)
// they also only fill the command pods batteries up to 50% of max EC compared to the stock fuel cells 95% 
// this is to reflect the lower energy density of monopropellant as a fuel, and to encourage you to use other power generation parts

// they make for a great emergency power generator!
